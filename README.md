Project 4 - Junior Web Developer program at OpenClassrooms

Goal is to understand the basic principles of PHP and SQL by creating a blog with a CRUD system for a writer publishing his work through chapters.

The project is requested to be built using the MVC structure.

Functionalities to implement:

# Users
- Users can select a chapter to read
- Users can comment under each chapter

# Admin / Writer
- Login system
- Access to basic CRUD on the chapters he writes
- WYSIWYG system for the writer to have a more pleasant interface to write his work
